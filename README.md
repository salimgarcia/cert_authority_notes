**Notes**
- The job of a certificate authority is to assist in validating the identity of different websites and devices before administering digital certificates to them
- A certificate authority takes the user’s public key and information and then creates a digital certificate
- The certificate is signed by the CA with its private key
- The user can present the signed certificate to a server, who can then trust that the user is who they claim to be
